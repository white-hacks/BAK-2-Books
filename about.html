                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    BAK 2 Books is an authentic creation of the Lortz sisters. We proudly present some of our world building work on this website. 
                </p>
                <h3>Meet Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are Bethany, Katlyn, and Anna Lortz. We are sisters and grew up in Denver, CO and Abingdon, VA. As children, we never got tired of playing pretend and acting movie characters. This tradition of ours grew into building our own characters and acting them out together. We go anywhere our endless imagination guides us.
                    With our combined skills, we have published a book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flag-Stand-Bethany-J-Lortz/dp/1725089300" target="_blank"><em>The Flag I Stand For</em></a>, and we do not intend to stop. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bethany, the eldest, is a writer and English teacher. Katlyn is a growing professional graphic designer, illustrator, and photographer. She is passionate about animals of all kinds. Anna, the youngest, is a talented painter and an avid animal lover.
                    Bethany and Katlyn both graduated from King University (Bristol, TN) in 2022.

                <h2>What Is World Building?</h2>
                <p>
                    World building is first creation. In our mind, we conceive a new dimension, a new reality, or a new world. This world has its own characteristics, its own landscapes, its own living beings, its own nature, its own characters, its own plots. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    World building, our style, is not just stories that come from our mind. It is bringing our characters to life, our plots to fulfillment, one whole new world to being. We are artists, and in the words of Rainer Maria Rilke, each new artwork is given a life of its own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may ask, what characters, worlds, and plots do we create? Our inspiration is mostly based on Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.
